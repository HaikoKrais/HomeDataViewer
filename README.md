# HomeDataViewer
App based on the Kivy GUI.

Show the weather in your city and the forecast for the next five days. The current weather and forecast is based on the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api). Please make sure to register there and get your own API key to download the data. Your key needs to be added in the MyVisuApp.py file at lines 338 and 339.
Also view measurements and graphs form your own temperature and humidity (or any other) measurements / sensors.

Detailed descriptions of the widgets and the framework can be found on my blog article (http://kraisnet.de/index.php/gebaeudedaten-erfassen-und-mit-kivy-visualisieren-2/18-gebaeudedaten-erfassen-und-mit-kivy-visualisieren)

All necessary dependencies you need to install to run the app can be found in the requirements.txt file.
